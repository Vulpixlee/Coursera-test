<h1>Magiczoology</h1>
<p>
<h4>If you're here, you,re probably a muggle or my family/close friend. My name is Zoe. I'm a Magizoologist. I have made this site to mostly to warn muggles who come across these animals and think they're crazy. I specalize in dangerous magical animals and magical animals that can be pets with training. Though I'm mosty known for my knowledge of magical animal training.I am also very fond of regular animals and cross breeds between the two.</h4></p>
